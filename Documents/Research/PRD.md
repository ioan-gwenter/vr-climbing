# VR Application for Climbing Education

---
## Background

With rock climbing becoming increasingly accessible, its popularity has introduced waves of new climbers to the sport. The project aims to introduce prospective climbers to the different aspects of climbing and inspire techniques/approaches without the need to set foot in the gym.

## Problem Alignment
- Product is a near-realistic VR climbing simulation that features all core skills that are required in a modern climbing gym

- Introduction of features should be intuitive and well communicated, whilst maintaining realistic parity to in-person climbing


### Goals
- Educate users on core techniques and safety considerations both in bouldering and lead climbing settings

- Interactions with the environment and objects/tools should feel tangible and realistic, without sacrificing accessiblity/functionality

- Provide a range of problems for users to attempt that demonstrate different techniques


### Non-Goals
- **Competitive Multiplayer Features**: The product will soley focus on education and individual skill. Whilst support may be set up for multiplayer, the core mechanics will not be designed for multiplayer.
- **Comprehensive training plans**. This product will not serve as a fitness/training app.
- **Specialised Gear Simulation**. The product will only focus on core climbing equipment (Belay devices, Rope, Harness, Basic Trad equipment), and not specific use-case equipment like ascenders, lanyards etc.
- **Guarantee Competency**. The product should REASSURE that this application will NOT be a direct substitute for in-person climbing training. The product simply aims to introduce core concepts in an accessible, gamified setting, rather than guarantee competency in real life.

## Soloution Alignment

### Key Features


1. **Hand Mechanics**:

    - Precise control of hand grip types (pinches, slopers, crimps) based on real-world holds.
    - Ability to dynamically adjust grip strength depending on hold type.
    - Intuitive gesture control to grab holds in different orientations.

2. **Climbing Movement Simulation**:
    - Foot placement system
    - Predictive body positioning to mimic techniques like flagging, stemming, and smearing.
    - Dynamic balance mechanics that react to user positioning or force applied to holds.

3. **Climbing Gear Interaction**:

    - Core gear usage such as ropes, harnesses, and belay devices, with tactile interactions for learning correct techniques.
    - Realistic rope dynamics and physics to demonstrate clipping, falls, and rope management.

4. **Interactive Tutorials**:

    - Hands-on tutorials that guide users through basic climbing techniques like weight shifting, grip selection, and efficient movement.
    - Virtual instructor offering real-time feedback on form, safety, and technique.


### Oppurtunity Requirements
1. **Route Variety**:

    - A range of preset routes/problems demonstrating various climbing techniques, from basic holds to advanced moves (e.g., dynos, heel hooks).
    - Indoor gym setting with adjustable walls for different angles (slabs, overhangs, vertical walls).

2. **Progress Tracking**:

    - Visual feedback and metrics to track improvement in climbing techniques and routes completed.
    - Optional challenges that encourage users to refine their skills by solving problems with specific techniques (e.g., no dynamic moves, only using crimps).

3. **Belaying Simulation**:

    - Realistic belaying mechanics where users learn how to belay a partner or practice auto-belaying.
    - Integration of rope management and tension control.

4. **Environmental Feedback**:

    - Sensory cues such as sound and subtle vibration when interacting with different holds or surfaces, enhancing immersion.
    - Visual and auditory safety alerts during incorrect form or risky actions (e.g., missed clips, poor foot placement).
